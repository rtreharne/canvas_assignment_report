There's is lots of good evidence of understanding the theory and salient literature but your lack of structure in places and tendency to tell the reader what you plan for your study, before telling us about the literature meant that you don't really provide a sound justification for why your study is interesting/important - a careful restructure, which I recall advising on your draft, is required. Your writing has improved post draft but in your new sections avoid the wordy, journalistic phrasing - keep sentences short and factual. You covered a lot of great literature but largely avoided telling the reader about species specific examples - please address this. Proving the detail of studies, eg, what species, how it was affecting etc will allow you to formulate testable hypotheses and make your discussion flow better. Be careful you understand what you mean by time budgets - we are not planning on generating these - ie. working out the percentage time birds engage in different activities - actually very difficult. You are focussing on behavioural responses to disturbance. Nearly everything is here, just needs a repackage and a bit of rewrite. Well done. CL\"],\n",
